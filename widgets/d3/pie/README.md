CTS Pie Chart with D3.js
========================

This example uses [CTS v0.9.2](http://treesheets.org/release/cts-0.9.2.js).

To run this example, `cd` into the directory and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. Visit `localhost:8000/index.html` to see the CTS pie chart and `localhost:8000/pie.html` to see the original.

The CTS pie chart uses `index.js` to call a function to render the pie chart when the graft operation is detected. The original uses `data.csv` to populate the chart with data and the CTS version uses data in the HTML.
