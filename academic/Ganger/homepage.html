        <li> hmm, updated every few years, whether needed or not... kids will do that to you, I guess.
<li> Everyone who thought "Greg never takes a vacation" is now proven wrong... family vacation to Hawaii, in July 2012, complete with surfing (really!).  Check out a <a href="surf/index.html">few action shots</a> of Gangers getting it done.
<li> We just launched a new research center focused on cloud computing.  Check out the <a href="http://www.istc-cc.cmu.edu/">Intel Science and Technology Center for Cloud Computing (ISTC-CC)</a>.
<li> Our <a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/746/"> 
          storage systems course</a> is being offerred regularly in the Spring terms (next is 2011). 
<li> In Fall 2010, I taught a PhD-level special topics class (it'd been awhile) on <a href="ece847.fall10/"> Data-intensive and Cloud computing and storage</a>.
<li> In July 2010, I testified before Congress about cloud computing in a <a href="http://democrats.oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=5012&amp;Itemid=2">hearing on the benefits and risks of moving federal IT to the cloud</a>.  It was a very interesting experience.
<li> In 2010, I was named <a href="jatras-award.html">Jatras Professor of ECE</a>.  An overwhelming honor.
<li> We've established (or are in the process of establishing) several clouds at CMU, including the CMU vCloud, an <a href="http://opencirrus.org/">OpenCirrus</a> site, and an OpenCloud site.
<li>  <a href="tim/">Tim </a> turned twelve in 2012.  Unreal how time flies. 
<li> <a href="will/"> Will </a> turned 10 in 2012.  Naturally, he and his brother fight all the time ;).
<li>  Tim and Will make it tough 
          to keep web pages up to date, but lots of research progress is happening 
          too. Check out my <a href="papers/"> publications page</a> for recent 
          and previous papers.

        Research Interests</a>

      <blockquote> 
        <p> I have broad research interests 
          in computer systems, including storage/file systems, distributed systems, 
          OS, and computer security. Most of my current research 
          explores these topics in the broad context of storage systems and
          large-scale infrastructures within 
          CMU's <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/">Parallel Data Lab (PDL)</a>, 
          for which I serve as Director. </p>
        <p> See the PDL pages for more current information, since this page
          gets updated rately, but... Together with industry collaborators 
          and other members of CMU's <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/">Parallel 
          Data Lab (PDL)</a> and CMU's <a href="http://www.cylab.cmu.edu/"> 
          CyLab</a>, my students and I are currently pursuing several 
          topics of research: </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li> Cloud computing and data-intensive computing, and especially their intersection.
        <li> <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/SelfStar/">Self-* 
          Storage Systems,</a> which automate and simplify storage administration 
          in clusters of self-configuring, self-organizing, self-tuning, self-healing, 
          self-managing, etc. storage servers. </li>
        <li> <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/Pasis/"> 
          Survivable distributed storage</a> (PASIS) that provide data availability and 
          security even after some successful breakins. </li>
      </li></ul>
      <p> <b>Other recent projects include:</b> 
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/Secure/">Better

          <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/Secure/S4.html"> self-securing storage 
          devices</a> that protect their contents from compromised OSes). </li>
        <li> <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/Fates/"> 
          Automated database storage management</a> (Fates) that matches data layouts and 
          access patterns to device-specific characteristics to increase performance and predictability. </li>

          storage system simulator</a> and the DIXtrac-enabled <a href="http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/DiskSim/diskspecs.html">database 
          of validated disk parameters for it</a>.) </li>
        <li> Design, implementation 
          and use of <a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ece843/">Systems of Active 
          Components</a>, including "intelligent" NICs, <a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~asn/">Active

      <h2> <a name="Teaching"> Teaching</a>

      <ul>
        <p> Currently on a cycle primarily consisting of 15-213/18-243 in
          Fall semesters and <a href="http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/746.spring12/">15-746/18-746</a> in Spring semesters.
        <p> In Spring 2001, Dave Nagle 
          and I created a new <a href="ece546.spring02/"> storage systems course 
          (18-546)</a>. It has, of course, evolved over the years.  We continue
          to teach it annually, now as 15-746/18-746.
        <p> In Fall 2000, I was drafted 
          at the last minute to teach <a href="712.fall01/"> 15-712 (graduate 
          OS and Distributed Systems)</a>. It was a lot of fun, and I taught it 
          again in Fall 2001 and Fall 2002.  
      </p></p></p></ul>

      <h2> <a name="Biography"> Brief 
        Bio (in reverse order)</a> </h2>
      <ul>
        <p> In addition to research 
          and teaching, I enjoy spending time with my wife, <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~jganger/">Jenny</a>, 
          playing various sports (basketball, in particular), and occasionally 
          sleeping. Of course, with the arrivals of <a href="tim/"> Tim</a> and 
          <a href="will/"> Will</a>, all of that became irrelevant.  
        <p> I spent 8/95 thru 11/97 
          as a postdoc in <a href="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/~kaashoek/">Frans 
          Kaashoek</a>'s <a href="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/"> research group 
          (PDOS)</a> at the <a href="http://www.lcs.mit.edu"> MIT Lab for Computer 
          Science</a>. During that time, I participated in the design and development 
          of the <a href="papers/exo-sosp97.html">exokernel operating system</a>. 
          I also pursued (with others, of course) a number of specific projects, 
          most of which are mentioned above.  
        <p> In a previous life (i.e., 
          prior to August 1995), I was a graduate student in Yale Patt's <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/HPS/"> 
          research group </a> in the University of Michigan's <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/acal/acal.html"> 
          Advanced Computer Architecture Lab </a>. Although the group's main focus 
          is on compilation for and implementation of high-performance processors, 
          my research was focused on file systems and storage subsystem architecture. 
           
        <p> I earned all of my collegiate 
          degrees (B.S., 1991, M.S., 1993, Ph.D., 1995) from the University of 
          Michigan. I grew up in Michigan (Troy, post-1980) and Northern Ohio 
        (Sylvania, pre-1980).         
      </p></p></p></p></ul>
